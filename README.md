# Salvaging Indicator
Show when the player is salvaging, sorting, or idle for maximum AFK!
Please make sure to set your crewmates and idle settings in "Salvaging Tracker" configuration page.

# Known Bugs
- When taking over a facility from another crewmember, their status is not updated until they move, resulting in some delay.
- I have only tested with Jobless Jim and Ex-Captain Siad, please report if other crewmembers do not work.
